***Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Chronic Diseases to Promote Global Market Share of Radiotheranostics***

The increasing use of tailored medications in the treatment of cancer is one important factor propelling market rise. Advances in cancer biology, therapy alternatives, and diagnostics have all impacted the concept of personalized medicine in cancer care. According to the most recent estimates, patients with a range of infectious and chronic diseases, rare genetic diseases, and cancers can use over 75,000 genetic testing kits and 300 tailored drugs. 

Moreover, pharmaceutical companies' enhanced attempts to develop innovative radiotheranostics with longer half-lives and better treatment outcomes will likely also provide new market opportunities. In April 2022, for instance, ITM announced that patient recruitment for their phase III research, COMPETE, which included ITM-11 as its principal candidate for targeted radionuclide therapy, had been successfully finished. Furthermore, Novartis said that Pluvicto (Lu177), a medication that the FDA approved in March 2022, can be used to treat adult patients with certain kinds of metastatic malignancies.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global radiotheranostics** market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Cancer Illnesses
- Rising Innovations Worldwide

***Challenges:***

The high cost of radiopharmaceuticals and radiotheranostics procedures can provide challenges for both patients and healthcare providers. The affordability and cost-effectiveness of these technologies need to be addressed in order to ensure increased adoption and market expansion. Regional variations may exist concerning the accessibility and availability of facilities and equipment for radiotheranostics. Inadequate infrastructure and resources in some areas may make it more difficult to apply radiotheranostics widely. Reimbursement policies and coverage for radiopharmaceuticals and radiotheranostics procedures may be limited in specific circumstances. This could result in financial hardship for both patients and medical professionals, which would prevent radiotheranostics from being widely used. 

By approach outlook, the global radiotheranostics** market is segmented into targeted therapeutics and targeted diagnostics. The targeted therapeutics segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. One aspect of the focused treatment strategy in the field of radiotheranostics is the use of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted therapy. The fact that these radiopharmaceuticals are designed to target and deliver radiation to specific illness targets or cancer cells within the body has an impact on the market expansion. By 2020, cancer will account for over 10 million fatalities worldwide, or about one in six deaths. The reason for the market's growth is that radiopharmaceuticals can bind to tumor cells specifically and deliver a therapeutic dose of radiation to kill or stop the growth of cancer cells. This is achieved by combining a therapeutic radioactive ingredient with a targeting molecule, such as peptides or antibodies.

By region, the North America radiotheranostics** market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. The market in the Europe region is expected to grow at a significant share over the forecast period. The strong healthcare system and rising patient numbers are driving the European market. Furthermore, the need for radiotheranostics is being driven by the growing desire for precision oncology and tailored therapy. The market is expanding as a result of the expanding healthcare system and the regulatory bodies in Europe enacting various laws to promote radiotheranostics.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global radiotheranostics** market which includes company profiling of Clarity Pharmaceuticals, Ariceum Therapeutics GmbH, Novartis AG, Bayer AG, Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Telix Pharmacuticals Limited, ITM Radiopharma, and others.
