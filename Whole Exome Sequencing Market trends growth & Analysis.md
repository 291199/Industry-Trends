***Growing Prevalence of Rare Disease to Promote Global Market Share of Whole Exome Sequencing***

According to the National Center for the Advancement of Translational Sciences, one in ten Americans, or 30 million people, is believed to be affected by one of the more than 10,000 identified rare diseases. Heuristic methods that combine clinical knowledge from previous accounts of unusual diseases with the medical literature are an important part of traditional diagnostic techniques. Many people with rare diseases go years without a diagnosis and many even die.

Exome sequencing has thus made it possible to identify the underlying molecular mechanism of these rare and undiscovered diseases. Hence, it is estimated that this factor is expected to drive the growth of the market.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global whole exome sequencing market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

***•***	Reduction in Cost of Sequencing

***•***	Increasing Number of Children Born with Genetic Defects

***Challenges:***

Certain exons may not be captured. Current standard human genome annotations may not include the important exon, and it is simply difficult to cover the entire exome with currently available WES technology. Thus, disease-causing mutations in these "missing" exons go unnoticed. When as complete an exon coverage as possible is required, WGS has been shown to provide more extensive exome coverage than WES. Hence, this factor is considered to be hampering the growth of the market.

By application, the global whole exome sequencing market is segmented into diagnostics, drug discovery & development, personalized medicine, and agriculture & animal research. The personalized medicine segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment is due to the increasing prevalence of several types of cancer. With more people than ever having their first cancer diagnosis later in life, second cancers are becoming more common. One in five cancer patients in the United States has already experienced another malignant disease. Therefore, more and more value is being placed on personalized medicine. 

By region, the North American whole exome sequencing market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. About half of all Americans (about 45%, or 133 million) had at least one chronic disease in 2018, and the number is growing. Chronic diseases are a special category of silent diseases that, if not treated in time, can cause irreversible damage in humans. Therefore, the market for whole exome sequencing is growing in North America. Additionally, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is emerging as a powerful tool to gain deeper and more precise insights into the molecular basis of individual tumors and specific receptors as information-driven pharmacology continues to grow. Genomics continues to play a greater role in the treatment of multiple chronic diseases. Diseases, especially cancer in North America.
