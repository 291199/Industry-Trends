***Increasing Prevalence of Chronic Diseases to Drive Growth of the Global Automated Cell Culture* *Market***

An increase in clinical trials and investments in tailored drugs in developing countries such as Australia, China, the US, India, and others is driving the growth of the automated cell culture market. Most labs that carry out activities related to drug development, protein expression, cell signaling, and other relevant tasks use automated cell culture equipment. These methods help technicians avoid mistakes and save time. Without a doubt, it's a really helpful tool for studying human diseases. The recommended investment value for the Indian pharmaceutical and medicine industry in the fiscal year 2022 was roughly USD 97 million. 

Furthermore, a multitude of factors have demonstrated their responsibility for the growth of the automated cell culture industry. Among the few are increased investments in the development of new products, drug discoveries, and stem cell research and development. Among other things, vaccine production and gene treatment have increased.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global automated cell culture** market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Rising Incidence of Chronic and Infectious Diseases
- Development Technological Advancement* 

***Challenges:***

Organizations and research facilities must make significant investments to automate cell culture. The cost of these systems is further increased by the strict production criteria required to get market certification for the equipment from numerous governmental agencies. Moreover, substantial production costs are needed to integrate information technology (IT) into laboratory automation devices, which raises the cost of equipment. The expansion of the global market for automated cell culture is anticipated to be restricted by the high initial and ongoing costs involved, as small-scale research labs and organizations are unable to construct such expensive equipment. The high cost associated with automated cell culture is expected to hamper the market growth. 

The global automated cell culture** market is segmented into product type, equipment type, end user, and application, where product type is sub-segmented into consumables and equipment. By the end of 2036, the equipment segment is anticipated to garner the largest revenue of USD 24.06 billion with a CAGR of 8.49% over the forecast period. Automated cell culture equipment is made to simplify and speed up any cell culture procedure. Automated cell culture tools are utilized in laboratories because they carry out the necessary tasks to establish and maintain a cell culture mechanically. Many tasks, including plating cultures, dilution of samples, continuous spinning of cultures in liquid culture, and well-depositing of cultures, can be carried out using automated cell culture equipment. Automated cell culture systems have become more and more popular because they provide the best cell lines for all stages of seeding, feeding, massaging, and cell multiplication. They lessen human error while assisting in meeting strict requirements and standards. With the increasing usage of high-throughput cell lines in drug discovery investigations, there is an increasing demand for automated cell culture equipment.

Over the forecast period of 2024-2036, the Asia Pacific automated cell culture** market is predicted to develop at a CAGR of 9.23%. The Asia Pacific market was worth USD 2.55 billion in 2023, and it is expected to be worth USD 7.94 billion by the end of 2036. The automated cell culture market is growing at the quickest rate in the Asia Pacific region as a result of an aging population and an increase in the occurrence of cancer. For instance, one in four individuals in Asia and the Pacific will be over 60 by 2050, according to the Asian Development Bank. Between 2010 and 2050, the number of senior people (those over 60) in the region will treble, approaching 1.3 billion. Furthermore, more than one in ten deaths in the WHO South-East Asia Region were linked to cancer in 2014, with an estimated 2.2 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths due to the disease reported in the same year.
