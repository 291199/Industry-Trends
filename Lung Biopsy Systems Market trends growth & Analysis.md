The global lung biopsy systems market is projected to grow at a CAGR of ~10% by attaining a remarkable revenue during the forecast period, i.e., 2022 – 2031. A significant requirement for lung biopsy systems owing to the higher prevalence of lung diseases across the globe is anticipated to propel the growth of the market during the forecast period. *World Health Organization (WHO) published a report showing that in 2019, 3.23 million people died due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).* Additionally, by procedure type, the global lung biopsy systems market is segmented into transbronchial, thoracoscopic, and open biopsy. Out of these sub-segments, the open biopsy segment is estimated to obtain a notable share in the market during the forecast period. The growth of the segment can be accounted to the requirement for open biopsy by a large number of patients. Open biopsy is usually performed to diagnose the early sign of any sort of disease in the lungs. *For instance, about 0.5 million bronchoscopies are performed annually in the USA.* Bronchoscopy is a procedure that is utilized to diagnose and treat lung diseases by examining air passages. 

Furthermore, the global lung biopsy systems market, by region, is bifurcated into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa region. Out of these regions, the market in the North America region is estimated to grow at a remarkable pace over the forecast period on the back of the increasing geriatric population and the presence of a well-organized healthcare infrastructure. *World Bank released a set of data stating that the geriatric population of the United States was 55,131,698 in 2020.* Moreover, the well-structured healthcare system of North America and rising awareness of people toward chronic diseases are also expected to hike the growth of the market in the region during the forecast period. *For instance, the USA is estimated to be the country with the highest health expenditure, the national health expenditure of the USA is projected to be about USD 3.5 trillion*.
