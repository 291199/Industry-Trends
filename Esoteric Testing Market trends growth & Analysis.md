Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Esoteric Testing Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/esoteric-testing-market/3832): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global esoteric testing market in terms of market segmentation by test type, technology, end-user, and by region.

***Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Chronic and Rare Disorders to Drive Growth of the Global Esoteric Testing Market***

The global esoteric testing market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased prevalence of several sorts of chronic disorders, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and so on throughout the world. *For instance, by the end of 2020, the prevalence of chronic diseases increased worldwide by almost 57%.* Such an increasing proportion of chronic disorders is fueling up the demand for advanced testing solutions which has been fulfilled by esoteric tests.

Moreover, the increasing frequency of rare diseases across the globe is also projected to expand the market growth as these disorders are severe and life-threatening. Such disorders are referred to as disabling lifelong disorders by the World Health Organization. Numerous types of cancers, autoimmune disorders, metabolic disorders, and hereditary abnormalities are types of rare diseases. A small proportion of rare disorders are identified, when neonates undergo the newborn baby screening test immediately after delivery. If detected early, the majority of the conditions that are examined can be cured. Hence, the growing occurrence of these disorders is also estimated to fuel the growth of the market in the coming years. *For instance, almost 350 million people globally were predicted to suffer from a rare disease in 2019.*

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global esoteric testing market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in the Utilization of Specialized Rapid Testing Kits
- Significant Spike in Genetic Testing

  ***Challenges:***

  The lack of reimbursement for esoteric tests is majorly influencing the frequency of diagnostic testing. Since Medicare coverage for personalized medicine is incredibly regulated. In addition to this, the rigorous regulations developed by the government of nations worldwide are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global esoteric testing market.

  By test type, the global esoteric testing market is segmented into infectious disease, endocrinology, oncology, toxicology, immunology, genetic testing, and others. The infectious disease segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Since infectious disorders are highly prevalent in individuals of all age groups. Infectious diseases are diseases that are caused by pathogenic bacteria such as viruses, fungi, or parasites. Infectious diseases are often spread through person-to-person contact, infected water or food, or insect bites. Moreover, poor hygiene and sanitation both contribute to the spread of infectious disorders. *For instance, in 2019, there were around 10.5 million visits to medical offices in the U.S. for infectious and parasitic disorders.*

  By region, the North American esoteric testing market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by well-established healthcare infrastructure and high healthcare expenditure in the region. *As reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, healthcare expenditures in the U.S. increased by 9.7% in 2020, expanding to USD 4.1 trillion, or USD 12,530 per person.* Moreover, the surging frequency of diagnostic testing, followed by the rapidly increasing ratio of chronic diseases, along with the growing geriatric population is also projected to push the market growth further throughout the projected time frame in the region. In addition to this, the significant increase in rare diseases, coupled with the proliferating outlays in research and development activities for the treatment of rare disorders are also estimated to boost the growth of the esoteric testing market in the concerned region in the coming years.
