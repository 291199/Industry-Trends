**Building Information Modeling Market trends growth & Analysis**



**“Global [Building Information Modeling Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/building-information-modeling-market/3219) - Key Insights 2023-35** 

During the forecast period of 2023-2035, the global building information modeling market is expected to reach an estimated value of ~USD 23.9 billion by 2035, by expanding at a CAGR of ~14%. The market further generated a revenue of ~USD 6 billion in the year 2022. Major key factors propelling the growth of building information modeling market worldwide are the growing urbanization that demands proper town planning and the escalating penetration of digitalization in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. 

**Market Definition of Building information modeling** 

Building information modeling (BIM) is the stepping stone of digital transformation in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry as it is becoming crucial for the planning, designing, and construction of structures and buildings. It is a process supported by various tools, technologies, and contracts involving the generation and management of digital representations of the physical and functional characteristics of places. Building information models are computer files that can be extracted, exchanged, or networked to support decision-making regarding a built asset. The software is used by individuals, businesses, and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain buildings and diverse physical infrastructures. 

**Global Building Information Modeling Market: Growth Drivers** 

The growth of the global building information modeling market can majorly be attributed to the increasing construction activities, backed by the growing urbanization in developing countries along with the rising global population. *According to data from the World Bank, 55.71% of the total global population was living in urban settlements in 2019, which accounts for around 4.2 billion people, whereas by 2050, 7 out of every 10 individuals are estimated to live in cities.* On the other hand, there is an expanding requirement for residential and commercial infrastructures to support this increasing urban population, which has resulted in massive growth in the construction industry that is also projected to drive market growth. *The construction industry was valued at more than USD 10 trillion in 2019.* 

The global building information modeling market is also estimated to grow majorly on account of the following: 

- Increasing penetration of digitization and innovative software in the architectural planning and modeling sector 
- Growing importance of virtual models in the pre-construction stage for architectures and engineers
- Rising construction of infrastructures such as roads, railways, bridges, ports, and tunnels
  - Rising prevalence of cloud-based solutions in the AEC industry
  - Increase in government regulations for employing BIM worldwide for safer infrastructural development

**Global Building Information Modeling Market: Restraining Factor** 

Poor software interoperability is regarded as an obstacle to BIM adoption in particular. Also, the cost-effectiveness of BIM for small projects is hampering market growth. Hence, this factor is expected to be the major hindrance to the growth of the global building information modeling market during the forecast period. 



**Global Building Information Modeling Market Segmentation**   

- **By Building Type (Residential, Public Infrastructure, Commercial, and Others)** 

  The residential segment, amongst all the other segments, is anticipated to garner the largest revenue by the end of 2035. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the increasing need to provide housing for the growing population, as it is a primary need for livelihood. In November 2022, the global population is expected to reach 8 billion. 

- **By Project Phase (Pre-Construction, Construction, and Operation)**
- **By Application (Planning & Modelling, Construction Designing, Asset Management, Interior Analysis, and Others)**
- **By End-User (Architects, Engineers, Builders & Contractors, Construction Managers, and Others)**
- **By Region** 

The Asia Pacific building information modeling market is anticipated to hold the largest market share by the end of 2035 among the markets in all the other regions. The increasing construction activities in developing nations, including, India, China, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam, as well as the infrastructural development of the tier 2 cities in the region, along with the introduction of advanced digital technology in the infrastructure domain, are expected to boost market growth in the projected period. For instance, it was found that Indian government spending on infrastructure projects grew exponentially in Q2 2022. The capital expenditure in Q2 2022 rose 57% to reach USD 20 billion, compared to Q2 2021.
