***Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Chronic Diseases Such as Type 1 Diabetes to Drive Growth of Global Mesenchymal Stem Cells Market*** 

The global mesenchymal stem cells market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing number of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes globally. Type 1 diabetes can be treated with stem cell therapy since it has been documented that when cord blood stem cells were being used for the treatment, patients didn’t take insulin injections. As of 2021, it was estimated that around 8 million people were living with type 1 diabetes worldwide. On the other hand, escalating instances of genetic disorders and diseases are also anticipated to influence market growth positively over the forecast period. Stem cells are known to heal damaged tissues by a genetic mutation. To treat genetic diseases, the main type of cells used are known as adult stem cells. For instance, in every 10 people, 6 of them are estimated to be diagnosed with health conditions having genetic background. 

Furthermore, the global mesenchymal stem cells market is also anticipated to grow on the back of an upsurge in the cases of Parkinson’s disease in the global population. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy has been noticed to treat the cells which are damaged by Parkinson’s disease. For instance, the annual rate of newly diagnosed cases of Parkinson’s disease was anticipated to be around 88,0000. Additionally, the rising demand for mesenchymal stem cells to treat cardiovascular is also expected to expand the market size over the forecast period. With required lifestyle modification, cardiovascular disease is observed to be treated with mesenchymal stem cell therapy. As of 2020, nearly 350,000 people were killed by coronary heart disease.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global mesenchymal stem cells market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing Geriatric Population 
- Rising Demand for Stem Cell Treatment to Cure Parkinson’s Disease 

***Challenges:***

The possibility of tumor growth and administration site reaction coupled with the formation of inappropriate cell types are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global mesenchymal stem cells market. Mesenchymal stem cells have a high potential for site reaction and tumor growth. Additionally, the cost of stem cell treatment is comparatively very high which can range up to 30,000 U.S. dollars. Hence, all these factors are expected to hamper the market growth over the forecast period. 

By type, the global mesenchymal stem cells market is segmented into bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose tissue, molar cell, and others. The umbilical cord segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment can be ascribed to the surge in awareness of the high regenerative properties of umbilical cord cells. Furthermore, the growth in the storage of cells is on account of growing technological advancement in the medical field. The umbilical cord is highly advantageous to treat genetic disorders, immune deficiencies, and several types of cancers. It was anticipated that in the United States around 450,000 individuals are observed to have immune deficiency diseases (PIDDs). Additionally, the bone marrow segment is expected to acquire the second-largest share of the market over the forecast period. therefore, all these factors are expected to drive segment growth in the forecast period. 

By region, the Asia Pacific mesenchymal stem cells market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by a higher number of people suffering from several types of cancer coupled with the rising number of people aged above 65 anticipated drive the market growth over the forecast period in the region. It has been medically proven that stem cell therapy can treat damaged cancer cells or regenerate new cells. Hence, a higher prevalence of cancer is projected to hike the demand for mesenchymal stem cells over the forecast period. It was observed that 50% of global cancer cases are diagnosed in the Asia Pacific region. Furthermore, the market is anticipated to hold the second largest market share in the North American region over the forecast period on the back of escalating cases of Parkinson’s disease and other chronic diseases. For instance, it was noticed that 90% of geriatrics in the USA are diagnosed with a minimum of 2 chronic diseases. 

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global mesenchymal stem cells market which includes company profiling of Bio-Techne Corporation, Merck KGaA, Genlantis, Inc., Celprogen Corporation, PromoCell GmbH, Cyagen US Inc., Plus Therapeutics, Inc., Human Longevity, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Pluristem Therapeutics Inc., and others.
