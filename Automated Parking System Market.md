**Automated Parking System Market** 

*Research Nester assesses the growth of the global automated parking system market which is anticipated to grow significantly on account of increased focus on development in urban infrastructure and smart city initiatives.*

New York – March 31, 2023 - Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“Automated Parking System Market: Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global automated parking system market in terms of market segmentation by automation, type, end user, and by region. 

***Rapid Urbanization Across the Globe to Drive Growth of Automated Parking System Market***

The global automated parking system market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing demand for automated parking system in shopping mall, commercial buildings, stadium, hospital & universities, among others. Automated parking technology offers the same number of parking spaces in a portion of the space. This technology has been completely ignored by urban planners to date, despite the fact that it holds the promise of making communities more usable, financially viable, and livable. The need for more planned urban infrastructural solutions is a significant driver for the automated parking system market as global urbanization rises.

According to the World Bank, more than fifty percent of the world's population presently resides in urban areas. The global urban population is going to rise by 1.5 times to 6.0 billion by 2045. The expansion of urban land consumption is expected to add 1.2 million km2 of new urban built-up area to the globe by 2030, outpacing population growth by as much as 50 percent. This sprawl places a strain on land and natural resources, which increases the need for more efficient parking solutions and also contributes to the global increase in demand for automated parking systems. For instance, in 2022, Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has approved Bosch and Mercedes-Benz highly automated parking system for use in the P6 parking garage run by APCOA at Stuttgart Airport. This makes the world’s first highly automated driverless parking function to SAE Level 4 to be officially approved for commercial use.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global automated parking system market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Reduction of parking spaces in urban areas 
- Implementation of smart parking to improve utilization of existing parking spaces 

***Challenges:***

An automated parking system can be quite expensive. Comprised of both software and hardware parts, the construction of an automated parking system is a complicated process. These systems are constructed with highly efficient machines and software, which initially raises the construction cost. The cost of parking garages is impacted by various factors such as size, capacity, the number of levels, and whether or not the garages are underground or above ground. Automated parking systems are more challenging in terms of cost due to the wide variety of technologies and systems available, and not all of them operate in a comparable way. Thus, these factors have a significant impact on the market's expansion and are considered to hamper the market growth.

By automation, the global automated parking system market is segmented into semi-automated and fully automated. The fully-automated segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growing sales of luxury cars and the development of new automated system has significantly boosted the demand for fully automated parking systems.

By region, the North American automated parking system market is to generate notable revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by the presence of a large number of automated parking system players which is one of the key factors driving growth in the region. On the other hand, the United States is one of the leading manufacturers of automobiles, and the technology used for automation has rapidly increased, which is further expected to drive market growth in the region.
