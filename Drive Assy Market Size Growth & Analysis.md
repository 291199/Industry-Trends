***Increasing Need for Automated Guided Vehicles to Promote Global Market Share of Drive Assy***

Due to the increasing need for automated guided vehicles (AGVs) globally, manufacturers of AGVs are in high demand for efficient drive assemblies. It is projected that there will be more than 272,700 automated guided vehicles (AGVs) available worldwide by 2025. Because automated guided vehicles may increase productivity, save labor costs, and improve safety, they are commonly used in the warehouse and logistics industries. These vehicles are made to move materials and goods inside buildings without assistance from humans. Excellent drive assemblies are needed to allow AGVs to move with precision and ease. These drive assemblies give AGVs the power transfer, control, and maneuverability they need to follow paths, avoid obstacles, and navigate through challenging settings.  

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Drive Assy market are:
