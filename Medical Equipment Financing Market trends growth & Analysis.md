***Pandemic-Related Rise in Medical Equipment Use in Developing Economies to Promote Global Market Share of* Medical Equipment Financing**

The global medical equipment financing market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the growing use of medical equipment across developing economies as a result of the pandemic. As of 2020, there were nearly 70,000 ventilators in the United States, but as the pandemic reached its peak, hospital demands required an additional 45,000 ventilators to meet the demand for ventilators. The increasing demand for medical equipment and the need to upgrade existing equipment with the latest technologies has driven the growth of the medical equipment financing market. This has been further fueled by the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the need for advanced medical treatments and technologies. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global medical equipment financing market are: 

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing awareness of the benefits of financing medical equipment
- A rise in the number of government approvals for new medical devices over the past few years

***Challenges:***

The high cost of medical equipment and the lack of funding, especially in certain regions, is expected to be major obstacle to the growth of the medical equipment financing market. The high cost of medical equipment has made it difficult for hospitals and other healthcare facilities to purchase the necessary equipment. Additionally, stringent regulatory requirements, coupled with the long period needed to obtain approval for medical equipment financing, are expected to limit the market’s growth.
