Geogrphically, the writing instruments market is segmented into five regions including North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East and Africa. Among these, the market in North America is anticipated to witness the highest CAGR during the forecast period ascribing to the growing investments by leading market players, high demand for fancy coloring pens and continuous launching of creative writing products in the region.

**Escalating Demand for Luxury Writing Instruments to Boost Market Growth**

Luxury writing instruments are considered a powerful status symbol globally, especially in North America and Europe, which can be credited to the rich heritage of these regions. Apart from these, luxury pens have been a crucial item for corporate and other types of gifting, and as the tradition of cashless gifting is gaining traction in developed and developing economies, the demand for luxury products is evaluated to notice a hike. This in turn is predicted to drive growth to the market in the coming years.

However, increasing use of touchscreen devices is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the writing instruments market over the forecast period.
