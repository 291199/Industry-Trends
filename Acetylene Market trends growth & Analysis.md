**Market Definition of Acetylene** 

Acetylene is a colorless flammable gas formed by the reaction of calcium carbonate with water. It could also be produced using hydrocarbons such as coal, crude oil, and naphtha, and it could become extremely explosive when heated, compressed, liquefied, or combined with air. This gas is most typically employed as an intermediate in the manufacture of chemicals, as well as in metalworking applications for cutting and welding. It also has numerous uses in the production of acetylic alcohols and industrial dry-cell batteries, as well as in the chemical, automotive, transportation, aerospace, and pharmaceutical sectors.

**Global Acetylene Market: Growth Drivers** 

The growth of the global acetylene market can majorly be attributed to the growth in chemical production worldwide. For instance, India produced over 28 million metric tonnes of fundamental main chemicals and petrochemicals in the 2021 fiscal year. Acetylene is used in the chemical industry for many multiple aspects, including chemical synthesis to produce products including acetic acid, acetaldehyde, and acetic anhydride. These products are frequently used in the manufacturing of medicines, polymers, and other products. Further, during the projection period, the demand for acetylene would ultimately be driven by the quick industrial development brought on by technical breakthroughs to meet the growing wants of people from various end-use sectors. According to the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda, in April 2022, the manufacturing Index of Industrial Production (IIP) increased by 6.7%, electricity increased by 12.9%, and water and waste management increased by 15.4%. As a result, increased industrial output is an indication of global industry expansion, which would also raise demand for acetylene over the forecast period.

The global acetylene market is also estimated to grow majorly on account of the following:  

- Increasing Sales of Cars 
- Growing Use of Acetylene in Welding
- Surge in Material Processing Sector

**Global Acetylene Market: Restraining Factor** 

The market on acetylene has long faced serious environmental problems. The hazardous particulate matter emissions that take place during gas production have an impact on both the environment and living things. Airborne particles have an impact on visibility and air quality. Particle matter reduces visibility, which diminishes an area's aesthetics and utility and may have a negative impact on buildings and vegetation. When exposed in excess, acetylene gas causes rashes, asthma attacks, and irritation of the skin and respiratory tract. The detrimental effects of the gas are, however, a significant factor restricting the expansion of this market.

**Global Acetylene Market Segmentation**   

- **By Application (Welding, Chemical Synthesis, Portable Lighting, and Others)**

The chemical synthesis segment is anticipated to hold the largest market share over the forecast period. The manufacture of compounds which includes 1,4-butanediol, acetylenic alcohols, and others heavily utilizes acetylene as an intermediary. Additionally, the synthesis of certain vitamins such as vitamin A, E, and others makes extensive use of the gas acetylene. In order to create various polymers including PVDF, PVC, and others, acetylene is additionally combined with other chemicals such as hydrochloric acid, chorine, and others. The China Plastic Processing Industry Association reports that from 2015 to 2019, the production capacity for PVC resins increased from 23.47 million tonnes to 25.19 million tonnes. In 2021, it was predicted that the production of chemicals would increase by 3.9% globally.

- **By End-User Industry (Aerospace, Automotive, Chemical, and Others)** 
- **By Region** 

The Asia Pacific acetylene market is anticipated to hold the largest market share by the end of 2035 among the market in all the other regions, backed by rising sale for automobiles, along with presence of major automobile manufacturers in the region. In 2020, more than 3.49 million passenger and commercial vehicle units were sold in India, according to figures from the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF).
