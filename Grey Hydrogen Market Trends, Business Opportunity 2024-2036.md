New York –November 30, 2023- Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Grey Hydrogen Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/grey-hydrogen-market/5477)**: Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036**”** delivers a detailed competitor’s analysis and a detailed overview of the global grey hydrogen market in terms of market segmentation by source, production, application and by region. 

***Demand in the Agriculture Sector & advancements in Technologies to Promote Global Market Share of Grey Hydrogen*** 

Grey hydrogen is used to create ammonia, which is used to build fertilizers. Fertilizer demand is high worldwide because of the goal of lowering production costs while increasing crop yields and nutritious value. Food product consumption is on the rise due to factors such as the growing global population, expanding purchasing power, and increased disposable income, especially in emerging countries. This is expected to fuel the food industry and raise the requirement for fertilizer globally. It is anticipated that this will quicken market growth.

By production, the grey hydrogen market is segregated into ammonia production, methanol production, refineries, and chemical production. Amongst them, ammonia production is set to hold the majority market share over the forecast period. Ammonia demand in the fertilizer industry has been the main driver of this segment's expansion. Nitrogen or hydrogen can be converted into ammonia using the Haber-Bosch process. Furthermore, businesses are still searching for fresh, low- or zero-carbon investment opportunities. Grey hydrogen and NH3 are predicted to play a major role in helping the world achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. All of these variables ultimately contribute to the expansion of this segment.

By region, Europe is estimated to hold a significant market share. The EU's ambitious hydrogen strategy aims to drive innovation, scale up hydrogen production, and integrate it into various sectors while promoting renewable energy sources. Partnerships between industry leaders, government bodies, and research institutions underscore the region's commitment to fostering a hydrogen economy that gradually moves away from grey hydrogen towards more sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives, aligning with Europe's overarching goals of carbon neutrality and a circular economy.
