**Green Composites Market trends growth & Analysis**

**Global [Green Composites Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/green-composites-market/3888) Key Insights**

During the forecast period of 2023-2035, the global green composites market is expected to reach an estimated value of ~USD 165 billion by 2035, by expanding at a CAGR of ~8%. The market further generated a revenue of ~USD 95 billion in the year 2022. Major key factors propelling the growth of green composites market worldwide are the increasing concern over air pollution, and the rising benefits of green composites in various industries, including agriculture, construction, aerospace, and others.

**Market Definition of Green Composites** 

Green composites are biodegradable and recyclable materials that have matrices made up of natural fibers. They are also known as bio-composites and it is a mixture of bipolar matric and natural fibers, such as sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, oil palm fiber, wood flour, and others. The matrix used in green composites is crucial for keeping the fibers together, transferring loads, and protecting them from mechanical damage and environmental deterioration. Moreover, green composites lower the dependency on fossil fuels and reduce the stress on the environment.

**Global Green Composites Market: Growth Drivers**

The growth of the global green composites market can majorly be attributed to the rising air pollution and its harmful impact on human health followed by the depletion of fossil fuel which in turn will boost the usage of green composites. *One of the main causes of death worldwide, air pollution is blamed for millions of fatalities each year. Around 12% of deaths worldwide are related to air pollution.* Moreover, *it is expected that oil is likely to end in the next 30 years of time. Additionally, the gas is likely to deplete by 2060.* On the other hand, the market growth can also be attributed to the rising number of wastes that can be used in composting. Besides this, the rising benefits of composting in agriculture is also projected to drive the market growth. For instance, *around 28 % of the waste disposed of in landfills can be composted. Moreover, adding compost to the soil improves the water-holding capacity of the soil by 2.5 times. This results in a reduction in the amount of water that was supposed to be used.* 

The global green composites market is also estimated to grow majorly on account of the following:

- Rising concern regarding environmental safety
- Growing agricultural residue
- Depletion of fossil fuels in the world
- Government effort to boost utilization of green composite
- Rising usage of composites in agriculture, construction, and other industries

**Global Green Composites Market: Restraining Factor**

The manufacturing technologies used for green composites are not up to the standard. Moreover, the use of green composites in automobiles is limited due to their high price. Hence, these factors are expected to be the major hindrance for the growth of the global green composites market during the forecast period.

**Global Green Composites Market Segmentation**  

- **By Fiber Type (Wood Fibers, and Non-Wood Fibers)**
- **By End Use Industry (Healthcare, Packaging, Aerospace & Defense, Construction, Automotive, and Others)**

  The construction segment, amongst all the other segments, is anticipated to garner the largest revenue by the end of 2035. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the growing popularity of green buildings and sustainable materials for construction. *The market share of sustainable building systems is anticipated to represent 7.1% of the global market for sustainable building materials in 2026.* *Moreover,* *higher value at the point of sale was listed as one of the advantages of the most significant new green buildings by 26% of respondents in 2021.* 

- **By Region**

  The North America green composites market is anticipated to hold the largest market share by the end of 2035 among the market in all the other regions. The rising awareness about the benefits of composting in reducing the pollution among the end-users and rise in agricultural residue are expected to boost the market size in the region. *It would be the equivalent of taking 7.8 million cars off the road in the United States if everyone composted.* Moreover, *the total primary residue of agriculture in the United States is likely to reach around 320 million dry tones by 2030. Additionally, resources for processing and other garbage total between 20 and 26 million dry tones.*
