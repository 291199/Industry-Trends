An increase in investments by well-known companies in naphthalene derivative R&D is another factor anticipated to drive market growth for these products over the forecast period. A major factor driving the market's growth is the expanding usage of naphthalene derivatives in manufacturing facilities across several industries, including chemicals and paints & coatings. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global naphthalene derivatives** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Usage of Naphthalene Derivatives in Pharmaceutical Industry
- Rising Need for Naphthalene Derivative in Building Sector

**Challenges:**

Environmental hazards can result from the emission of naphthalene and its derivatives into the air via mothballs, cigarettes, wood burning, and inadvertent spills. Particles of soil easily absorb naphthalene and its compounds into water. They may easily vaporize into the atmosphere due to their volatility. In the presence of moisture and sunlight, naphthalene is rapidly transformed into 1- or 2-naphthol, which can enhance air toxicity and present a number of health risks. High concentration of dangerous, damaging compounds, changing energy costs and overproduction are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of naphthalene derivatives.
