***Growing Penetration of LEDs to Promote Global Market Share of LED Driver***

The global LED driver market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the surge in the demand for LED lighting not only in the residential sector but also across commercial and industrial sectors. *For instance, by 2030,* *LEDs are anticipated to make up 87% of lighting sources. Moreover,* *it was found that LED contributed to about ~51% of global lighting sales in 2020, with integrated LED luminaires holding the increased share.* Furthermore, so as to remain in line with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario forwarded by the International Energy Agency which ensures that by 2025 all countries sell only LEDs, the demand and usage of LED drivers is increased and is expected to drive the market growth. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global LED driver market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing Demand from the Building & Construction Sector
- Expansion in the Adoption of Smart Technologies in Smart Cities
- Growing Sales of Electronics

***Challenges:***

The rising concern about the lack of standardization in the manufacturing of the LED driver, and <a name="_hlk136270830"></a>the <a name="_hlk136275343"></a>concern about the possible premature failures of LED drivers owing to high internal operating temperature are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of LED drivers.

By driver type, the global LED driver market is segmented into constant voltage and constant current. The constant current segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The rising adoption of this driver type in industrial LED lighting applications as they avoid burnout/thermal runaway and are easier for designers to control applications is expected to propel the segment’s growth.

By end-user, the market is segmented into residential, commercial, and industrial. Amongst these 3 segments, the commercial segment is forecasted to pull in the majority of the share owing to the increasing adoption of high-efficiency, and less energy-consumption LEDs in commercial spaces.

By region, the Asia Pacific LED driver market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by high priority to electronics hardware by the governments in the countries such as China along with the rise in the electronic manufacturing industries in the region*. China is the largest manufacturing hub of the world's electronics, producing ~36% of global electronic products and making the country the largest node in the global electronics supply chain.*
