Research Nester has released a report titled **“[Propylene oxide Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/propylene-oxide-market/2804): – Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** which also includes some of the prominent market analyzing parameters such as industry growth drivers, restraints, supply and demand risk, market attractiveness, year-on-year (Y-O-Y) growth comparisons, market share comparisons, BPS analysis, SWOT analysis and Porter’s five force model.

The global propylene oxide market has shown significant growth on account of increasing application of propylene oxide as a chemical intermediate. Backed by this factor, the propylene oxide market is estimated to witness significant growth in the coming years. In 2019, the market accounted for a market value of USD 13875.7 million and is estimated to grow by a CAGR of 5% over the forecast period of 2023-2035. A significant trend in the propylene oxide market has been the development and commercialization of new production technologies, which not only reduces the production of by-products but also does not use any chlorine-based chemistry.

Regionally, the global propylene oxide market is segmented into North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa region. Among the market in these regions, the Asia Pacific propylene oxide market is estimated to witness highest growth throughout the forecast period. The region is home to some of the fastest-growing economies of the world, including China, India, Bangladesh, and others. The evolution of construction, automotive, food & beverage and other industries has further strengthened the overall economic growth of the region, which is further anticipated to create lucrative opportunities for the new entrants in the market.

***Increasing Use Of Propylene Oxide As A Chemical Intermediate to Drive the Market Growth***

Increased demand for propylene oxide for the production of chemical intermediates such as for the polyurethane and solvent industries, is a key factor expected to drive the growth of the market over the forecast period. The rapidly growing healthcare sector is also expected to create lucrative opportunities for the global propylene oxide market. Propylene oxide is used for low-temperature sterilization of medical devices, bandages, and various other pharmaceutical products. It also functions as an essential chemical intermediate for the manufacture of propylene glycol, which is widely used in the chemical, food & beverage, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. Over the forecasted period, this factor is expected to drive the growth of the global demand for propylene oxide.

However, the possible carcinogenicity associated with the application of propylene oxide along with the environmental liability associated with the chlorohydrin process for the production of propylene oxide** is expected to serve as a restraining factor in the growth of propylene oxide market during the forecast period.
