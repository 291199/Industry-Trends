The global display bonding adhesive market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing need for motor vehicles. For instance, motor vehicles come with a variety of displays, including heads-up displays and rear-seat entertainment systems, which require the usage of display bonding adhesives to ensure optical clarity and provide vibration resistance.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global display bonding adhesive market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Medical Sector Globally
- Rising Need for Electronic Appliances

***Challenges:***

The growing innovation in traditional technologies and the high cost of raw materials required for the production of display bonding adhesives are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of display bonding adhesives. For instance, to meet the evolving need of the industry continuous advancements are being made which may introduce new raw materials or new production processes. This, as a result, may impede the production of display bonding adhesives.

By type, the global display bonding adhesive market is segmented into optically clear adhesive, and liquid optical clear adhesive. The optically clear adhesive segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to the growing number of benefits offered by optically clear adhesives. The performance of device displays is enhanced by the use of optically clear adhesives since it effectively eliminates the gap between the LCD and cover glass. Besides this, optically transparent adhesive bonding is a pure UV curing adhesive which means that the sheet adhesive doesn't need to cure, as a result, it increases the contrast ratio and increases viewability by lowering the amount of reflected light. In addition, since they offer greater optical enhancement and anti-glare features, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are widely used in televisions and monitors. Further, by application, LCD displays segment is set to garner a notable share on account of the growing need for adhesives in LCD displays. Display bonding adhesives are used to join LCD and a protective glass panel to maximize the light transmission, accurate color, brightness, and clarity of LCDs, and minimizes the internal reflections between the LCD and the glass.

By region, the European display bonding adhesive market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by the growing demand for smart displays. Smart home technology is becoming more prevalent in the region which as a result has increased the demand for smart displays. These displays often incorporate touchscreen functionality which requires the usage of display bond adhesives to securely bond the display panel and ensure a user-friendly experience. This, as a result, has increased the demand for display bonding adhesives in the European market. In addition, the market in Asia Pacific is set to gain robust revenue on the account of growing demand for smartphones. Owing to rising personal disposable income in the region more and more people are buying smartphones, which may raise the demand for display bonding adhesives. For instance, these adhesives are used to improve the display quality and also enhance touchscreen performance. Further, the increasing investment in research & and development in the North American region will contribute to the market growth.
