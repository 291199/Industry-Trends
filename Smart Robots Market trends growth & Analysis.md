***Growing Adoption of Cloud by Organization Globally to Promote Global Market Share of Smart Robots***

The global smart robots market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the growing adoption of the cloud by organizations. For instance, these cloud robots make it simple for organizations to gather customer or client information. The data is subsequently kept in a remote-accessible database system that is housed in the cloud and used for operations, maintenance, and other functions. 

The global smart robots market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing spending on smart robots. For instance, the Vancouver-based Sanctuary Cognitive Systems Corporation, which focuses on robotics and AI, received an investment of roughly USD 29 million in 2022, according to François-Philippe Champagne, the federal minister of innovation, science, and industry. The Strategic Innovation Fund provided this financing, which was anticipated to support a USD 119 million initiative to develop the first general-purpose robots with functional intelligence on par with that of humans. With this investment, the government hoped to advance Canada's position as a leader in the commercialization of artificial intelligence.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global self-leveling concrete market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Increasing Utilization of Smart Robots in Hospitals
- Growing Production for Automobiles

***Challenges:***

A couple of major obstacles to the market’s expansion include the high cost of robots and their adaptability. For instance, the high cost of designing, producing a buying smart robots. Potential customers may be turned off by the initial expenditure necessary for new technology, components, and customization, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.

By application, the global market for smart robots is divided into welding and painting, assembling and disassembling, mobility, and inspection and security. The inspection and security segment is among those whose development is expected to be the greatest throughout the projection period. Intelligent security robots might maneuver through complex environments while identifying and reporting environmental issues. Because of its sensors and cameras, they can keep their balance even when moving through rough terrain. Also, thanks to improvements in 5G networks, robots can now explore wider and tougher locations. Additionally, smart robots are widely used in areas like defense ministries, rescue or emergency operations organizations, civic protection, law enforcement, and the sectors working for overall citizen security.

The market for smart robots in Asia is anticipated to hold a sizable portion of the smart robotics market. This is explained by the steady production of robots in China and South Korea for a variety of domestic and international applications. In addition, Youxiaomei, a robot, recently provided water and tea to participants at the 7th China Information Technology Expo in 2019. Additionally, the market is growing as a result of rising disposable incomes and the introduction of digital technology. Additionally, the use of smart robots for various functions is driving the growth of the regional market because the automotive industries in nations like Japan and China are booming. Thus, the market expansion of smart robots in the Asia Pacific area is being favored by these aspects.

The European market is also anticipated to experience considerable expansion. Europe dominates the markets for field robotics, logistics, and construction. This industry uses robotics in several applications, including industrial cleaning. The rapid growth of the European economy has led to a severe labor shortage in all industries. In supermarkets, hospitals, and other places, robots have been used to disinfect and clean the floors.
