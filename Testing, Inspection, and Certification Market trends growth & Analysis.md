The healthcare & medical sciences segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment is attributed to the increasing need for bioanalytical testing services and to ensure the safety of medical devices and equipment. The companies are working together to advance the adoption of testing, inspection, and certification services for pharmaceutical and medical devices. To increase its biopharmaceutical analytical testing capacity, SGS SA acquired Quay Pharma, a pharmaceutical research and development organization, in December 2021.

By region, the Asia Pacific testing, inspection, and certification market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035.
