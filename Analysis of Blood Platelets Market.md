***Growing Cases of Blood Related Disorder to Promote Global Market Share of Blood Platelets***

The global blood platelets market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing incidence of blood related diseases. Patients suffering from blood related disorders are reported to have low platelet counts which rises the need for more frequent blood platelets and need for healthy blood. *Anaemia is known to be one of the most common blood disorders throughout the world, and was prevalent in children at a rate of over 39% in the year 2019.*

The global blood platelets market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing rate of surgical procedures. Blood transfusions are frequently necessary during operations as many surgical procedures that involve major body organs such as the heart or liver require a larger count of platelets, especially in the elder population who are more prone to age-related diseases and low hemoglobin. *According to the WHO, around 2 million surgical procedures were performed in 2018. Additionally, the number of surgical burden cases will rise by 30% during the next five years.*

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global blood platelets market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Cases of Organ Transplantation
- Rising Rate of Trauma Injuries

***Challenges:***

The rising concern for risks associated with transmitted infections, and the exorbitant cost of treatment are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of blood platelets. For instance, the donated blood is examined and tested for potential viruses, bacteria, and parasites before transfusing, which also increases the cost of platelets. However, a variety of diseases, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, have the potential to spread during blood transfusions. The most frequently transmitted of them is bacteria. Acute immune hemolytic reaction, delayed hemolytic reaction, and graft-vs-host disease are further diseases that can spread. The likelihood of these illnesses occurring is quite low. Furthermore, there is often a shortage in supply of the platelets owing to the high demand which results in a high cost of obtaining the platelets.

By application, the blood platelets market is segmented into platelet function disorder, hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, and perioperative indication. The hemophilia segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The reason behind the growth can be attributed to the growing incidence of hemophilia. Hemophilia, which makes it difficult for the blood to clot. During the clotting process, blood platelets and tiny protein biomolecules that are clotting factors in the body collaborate to generate a clot. For instance, blood platelets are required in the case of hemophilia to reduce bleeding and to support clotting. In 2020, there were around 210,000 hemophiliacs globally. *Additionally, about 18,400 people in the United States were found to have hemophilia in 2021. In addition, 10,000 more persons suffer from various bleeding disorders.*

By region, the North America blood platelets market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by higher need for blood transfusions and the higher number of blood donations. The growing geriatric population, and growing cases of chronic diseases are the main factors contributing to the surging need for blood transfusion in the area. *According to the estimates, the number of Americans who require blood transfusions each year is over 4 million, and each day, over 43,000 pints of blood are donated across all of the United States and Canada.* Additionally, the region's market is anticipated to develop as a result of the increasing prevalence of surgical operations and the rising need for transplants, including kidney, heart, knee, liver, and corneal implants, among others. *For instance, in the US, heart disease is the main factor in both male and female fatalities. Approximately 500,000 open heart procedures are carried out annually. Further, there are nearly 121,000 kidney transplant candidates in the US right now.*
