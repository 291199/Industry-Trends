***Increase in Utilization of Energy and Demand for Energy Distribution to Drive the Market Growth***

*According to International Energy Agency, the World’s energy production amounted to 617 EJ in 2019 with more than a 2% raise from 2018.* 

With the increased economy of a growing population, the demand for sustainable energy is increasing significantly. With the demand for sustained energy, there is a need for shunt capacitors to support voltage transmission systems. *The worldwide energy demand grew by 4.6% in 2021, almost 70% of the projected increase is due to emerging industries and developing economy.*  Shunt capacitors allow the distributor systems to transmit high voltage power without any lag or resistance by reducing the inductive current. There is a need to push forward electric mobility globally and help customers increase efficiency. Such factors are anticipated to drive the growth of the market in the coming years. As per International Energy Administration, in 2021 more than 16.5 million electric cars are on road tripling the number in only three years.
