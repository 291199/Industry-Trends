***Growing Demand for Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing to Promote Global Market Share of Genetic Testing***

The global genetic testing market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing need for direct-to-consumer genetic testing. As a result, the number of people who can undergo genetic testing of their DNA (or genome) is growing which has been hailed as a significant advancement that boosts patient autonomy and gives customers more power.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global genetic testing market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Use of Online Websites for Product Purchases
- Rising Cases of Chronic Illnesses Globally

***Challenges:***

The high cost of genetic testing and the stringent regulations for product approvals are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of genetic testing. The cost of the genetic test depends on the type and complexity since the process takes time, the involvement of sophisticated medical technology is necessary, and is a work-intensive process.

By disease, the global genetic testing market is segmented into cancer, Alzheimer’s, thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, Huntington disease, and Duchene muscular dystrophy. The cancer segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to growing cases of hereditary diseases. The most prevalent genetic disease in humans is cancer, which is estimated to have more than 5% genetic component. For instance, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) is the most typical form of inherited breast cancer since they are caused by harmful mutations to the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. As a result, the demand for genetic testing may increase significantly.

By region, the Asia Pacific genetic testing market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by growing cases of cardiovascular disorders (CVDs). In comparison to the global average, the burden brought on by CVD in India is noticeably larger, and lately, one in four deaths in India is caused by CVDs. This may significantly increase the demand for genetic testing in the region as the therapeutic care of numerous inherited cardiovascular diseases is aided by genetic testing which helps in determining the reason why heart disease runs in a family, and can identify which particular relatives are at risk for developing it. *For instance, over 10 million people pass away each year in India, and it was noted that more than 20% of the deaths among males and roughly 16% of the fatalities among women were attributed to CVD.* 

Additionally, there has been a growing prevalence of obesity, endocrine disorders, and other health problems owing to the sedentary lifestyle in this region. Hence, the patient's adaptation to beneficial modifications, such as exercises and clearly defined nutritional needs for the body, has been prompted by these ailments and diseases. Therefore, over the projected period, there's going to be an increase in demand for nutrigenomic testing as a result of the positive effects of lifestyle and dietary changes on patient health and disease prevalence in this region.

In addition, the genetic testing market in North America is estimated to hold the second-largest share by the end of 2035. The growth can be attributed to a rise in the geriatric population who are more susceptible to any kind of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and CVDs. This, as a result, may lead to an increase in the demand for genetic testing is estimated to grow. Besides this, the growing count of improvements in technology in these regions is also anticipated to boost the growth of the market.
