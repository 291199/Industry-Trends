***Growing Demand for Electricity** **will increase the Global Market Share of the Cooling Meters Market***

The cooling meters market will encounter a remarkable increase because the increasing demand for these meters is projected to rise substantially due to several factors. Firstly, there is an increasing requirement for energy-effective solutions, and these meters give precise information on energy consumption, offering customers to recognize fields for modification and limit energy wastage. Secondly, rising awareness about climate change and ecological conservation is propelling the adoption of energy-saving technologies, comprising heat and cooling meters. Governments and regulatory bodies are also using robust energy effectiveness regulations, further driving the market expansion.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global cooling meters market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Emerging Technologies in cooling meters
- Rising Demand for in the summers across the world

***Challenges:***

Cooling meters market are not as extensively attainable as other kinds of heat meters. This is because they are a comparatively new technology and fewer manufacturers are making them. The restricted attainability of cooling meters can make it tough to get a qualified installer and can also take longer lead times for submission.

By product, the cooling meters market is segmented into ultrasonic and vortex. The ultrasonic segment will hold the highest revenue share with 66% owing to their extensive usage in different sectors and their smart structure. For instance, Kamstrup ultrasonic cooling meters are licensed in line with EN1434 – a robust European standard that confirms precision and longevity upon challenging ecological situations like humidity, electromagnetic radiation, and others, so you can be positive that every meter executes magnificently in your installation. 

By region, the APAC air-insulated switchgear market is to generate the highest revenue with a percentage of almost 37% by the end of 2036. The European region will also encounter a significant surge in the cooling meters market during the anticipated period. This region’s growth will be completely dependent on the investment strategies made by the European governments and private companies in cooling meters. For instance, on 14th November 2023 utilizing digital estimating technology presents an array of scopes to use the recent needs laid down in the German National Water Strategy. At Enlit, ZENNER will be showing a portfolio of digital products that can be implemented to this end. The organization has the bulk water meter IUW and the fresh domestic water meter IUWS – brand-fresh ultrasonic meters that amalgamate maximum accuracy with avant-garde interaction technology. Both can transfer meter information via wireless M-Bus radio or with LoRaWAN via the Internet of Things.
