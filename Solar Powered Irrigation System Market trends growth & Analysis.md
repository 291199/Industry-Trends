***Rise in Demand for Food to Boost the Global Solar Powered Irrigation System***

The global solar powered irrigation system market is set to have the growth owing to the rise in demand for food. Irrigation is one of the strategies that is estimated to increase yields, decrease sensitivity to shifting rainfall patterns, and enable a variety of agricultural practices. Hence, this strategy aims to feed a large number of the population since it guided in producing food of quality and in quantity. Therefore, to make this process more sustainable and cost-effective the adoption of solar powered irrigation system is poised to grow. Moreover, solar technologies are becoming a feasible option for both large-scale and small-scale farmers as the investment prices for solar powered irrigation systems (SPIS) are declining and SPIS subsidy schemes are being implemented. 

Moreover, in many remote parts of the world people doesn’t have an adequate source of electricity. Hence, the implementation of solar powered irrigation system is estimated to grow in those parts over the forecast period. The irrigation system working on solar energy lessens dependence on electricity or diesel, hence once installed, there is no ongoing cost for electricity or fuel. Additionally, as compared to the convention irrigation system, the solar powered irrigation system requires carries less maintenance cost. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global solar powered irrigation system are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Reduces Greenhouse Gases 
- Presence of Large-Scale Cultivated Land 

***Challenges:***

The price to install solar powered irrigation system is usually high. Hence, the farmers in developing nation finds it difficult in investing in such technology. Moreover, they are not further educated and aware regarding its benefits. Hence, usually restrain from adopting it. Moreover, there are a lot of disadvantages to solar irrigation systems, including the possibility that they won't produce enough electricity, particularly at night or when it's cloudy.  Therefore, solar irrigation is only useful in areas with abundant sunlight. Furthermore, if the land is obscured by trees or other structures, it might not receive enough sunshine to adequately power the system. This might even necessitate using a backup power source and lead to erratic watering schedules.

By application, the market for solar powered irrigation system is segmented into landscaping & gardening, and agricultural irrigation. Out of these segments, the agriculture irrigation segment is set to garner the highest revenue over the forecast period owing to the growing demand for food. However, owing to the irregular pattern of rain in many parts of the world it gets difficult to satisfy the growing demand for food. Therefore, irrigation is essential to agriculture's viability in areas with infrequent or irregular rainfall. Irrigation enhances agricultural growth and quality where precipitation is erratic. Hence, irrigation also contributes to more steady food supplies by enabling farmers to cultivate crops on a regular schedule. 

By region, the Europe market for solar powered irrigation system is poised to grow by the end of 2035. This can be attributed to the growing focus on clean energy sources. Moreover, the consumption of water in agriculture applications. The agriculture industry in Germany is one of the key industries that considerably contributes to the national economy. Additionally, the agricultural sector of the nation has transitioned from traditional farming practices to cutting-edge ones over the years. in Europe is growing, hence the need for irrigation system. Hence, with the growing technology advancement in agriculture sector the preference for solar powered irrigation system is also boosting.
