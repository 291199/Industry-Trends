The global cobalt free cathode market is estimated to grow on the back of increasing need to eliminate the use of cobalt in batteries, as cobalt is extremely expensive, involves dangerous mining process, and is toxic if not disposed carefully. Owing to these factors, researchers have developed cobalt free cathode for lithium-ion batteries, which are used in smartphones, electric vehicles, and other battery-powered appliances. As a result, the growing demand for lithium-ion batteries, backed by the surging sales of EVs, is projected to boost the market growth. *According to the data by the International Energy Agency (IEA), 2.1 million EVs were sold globally in 2019.* 

On the basis of geographical analysis, the global cobalt free cathode market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa region. The market in the North America region is anticipated to gain the largest market share during the forecast period on account of the escalating adoption of electric vehicles in the region. *According to the report by IEA, over 231,088 battery-powered electric vehicles were sold in the US in 2020.* Moreover, the higher implementation of advanced technologies across various sectors, in the developed countries, is predicted to boost the market growth. 

The research is global in nature and covers detailed analysis on the market in North America (U.S., Canada), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands & Luxembourg, NORDIC [Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark], Poland, Turkey, Russia, Rest of Europe), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of Latin America), Asia-Pacific (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Rest of Asia-Pacific), Middle East and Africa (Israel, GCC [Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman], North Africa, South Africa, Rest of Middle East and Africa).
