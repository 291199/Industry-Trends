***Escalating Use of Cloud Technology to Drive the Market Growth***

*In 2022, end users are expected to spend USD 5 billion on public cloud services.*

Cloud computing is based on the concept that the main computing occurs on a machine, often remote, which is not currently in use. Distant servers store and process the data gathered during this process (also called cloud servers). Cloud servers spare memory and computing power of individual computers by hosting software, platforms, and databases remotely. Therefore, organizations of all sizes, in all regions, and in all sectors are sourcing cloud services, which are fueling up the growth of the revenue assurance market. 

However, fluctuations in currency, deficit of administrative supervision, and shortage of expert personnel are expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the Africa revenue assurance market over the forecast period.
