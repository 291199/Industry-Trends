***Growing Industrialization, and Urbanization to Promote Global Market Share of Conveyor System***

The global conveyor system market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the surge in the industrialization, and urbanization rates across the globe. This can be attributed to the increasing use of conveyors for a variety of applications, such as bottling, food processing, automotive, aerospace, and others as the rate of industrialization has increased. Moreover, the Indian production rate increased by more than 4% year on year in December 2022, according to the most recent data. Furthermore, the conveyor system prepares the products for loading, transport, and storage while preventing damage. As a result, the goods manufactured in an industry go through various processes, increasing the use of conveyors. Therefore, it is anticipated to boost the growth of the global conveyor system market. 

Similarly, the global increase in warehouse space is driving up demand for conveyor systems to handle bulk stock, as it lowers labour costs, human errors, and workplace risks in warehouses. Furthermore, the goods are transported and sorted using conveyor belts, which is expected to boost the growth of the global conveyor system market over the forecast period. *The number of warehouses worldwide is expected to exceed 175,000 by the end of 2025, as per the estimates.*

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global conveyor system market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in the Number of Shopping Malls
- Increasing Expansion of Existing Airports

  ***Challenges:***

Owing to the rise in costs for the belt, hardware, truss, power supply, wire rope, and other items, the conveyor system is now quite expensive. Additionally, the conveyor system requires maintenance costs for things like repairs, insurance, registration, gasoline, and others. Over the projected term, this is anticipated to impede the market's expansion. Moreover, there are high chances of employee accidents in the industries owing to the inexperience they have while dealing with the conveyor system, such as belts. In addition, the lack of skilled labor for handling the conveyor system is also contributing to this factor. Therefore, it is anticipated to boost the growth of the market in the upcoming years. 

By industry, the global conveyor system market is segmented into food & beverage, automotive, retail & distribution, and others. The automotive segment is anticipated to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the increased vehicle production and the rising popularity of electric vehicles. Furthermore, automotive plants prefer overhead conveyers owing to their high load capacity and increased plant production rate. As a result, the segment's market growth is expected to increase. *According to estimates, the number of electric vehicles on the road, which includes electric vans, buses, cars, and heavy trucks, will exceed 145 million by the end of the year 2030.*

By region, the Europe conveyor system market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by the presence of large automotive companies, and strict regulations regarding the safety of employees working in manufacturing units such as automotive industries have been implemented in the region. According to the European Commission, at least 2.6 million people are employed in the direct manufacturing of motor vehicles. Furthermore, there is a need to reduce labour costs, which is expected to drive the region's market growth. Moreover, by the end of 2035, it is anticipated that the Asia Pacific conveyor system market will rank second, with a share of nearly 24%. The market's expansion may be largely ascribed to the growing demand from manufacturing businesses to automate their processes as well as the accelerating development of numerous industries, including the aviation, automotive, mining, and other sectors.
