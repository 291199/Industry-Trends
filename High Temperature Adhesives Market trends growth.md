The global high temperature adhesives market is estimated to grow majorly on account of an increase in green building construction projects in the construction industry. According to estimates, over 60% of plans undertaken by 46% of firms in 2021 were green building projects, and 35% intend to renovate or build green in existing buildings. The growing demand for eco-friendly construction materials and the increasing focus on using renewable energy sources and reducing emissions are driving the demand for high temperature adhesives. High temperature adhesives are used in green building construction projects to ensure the durability of the building, as well as reduce energy consumption. They also provide superior insulation and moisture resistance, which is essential for buildings to be certified as green buildings.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global high temperature adhesives market are: 

***Growth Drivers:***

- The development of new technologies such as nanocomposites
- Growing demand for green adhesives 

***Challenges:***

The high cost of raw materials and the need to adhere to strict environmental regulations can cause manufacturers to incur high production costs, leading to a decrease in profits. In addition, high temperature adhesives contain hazardous chemicals, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can pose a risk to human health and the environment. As a result, governments are increasingly implementing stringent regulations to eliminate the use of these chemicals to protect public health and the environment. 

By adhesive resin type, the global high temperature adhesives market is segmented into epoxy, silicone, polyurethane, acrylic, and other resin types. The epoxy segment is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period because epoxy adhesives are highly versatile, durable, and strong, making them ideal for a wide variety of applications including construction, electronics, and aerospace. Additionally, they have excellent heat and chemical resistance, which makes them well-suited for high temperature applications. Moreover, the growing demand for structural adhesives from the automotive industry, due to their excellent performance and cost-effectiveness, is expected to provide a major boost to the epoxy segment
