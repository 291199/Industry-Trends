***Growing Trend for Sustainable Products to Promote Global Market Share of Recycled Carbon***

As consumers grow more aware of their carbon footprints, they are actively shopping for sustainable items. Additionally, there is an increasing need for carbon-recovery materials since it allows businesses to produce sustainable products and reduce their carbon emissions. According to a survey, products with sustainability claims grew 2.7 times faster than those without. Online sales of sustainable products outpace in-store sales by 75%. Consumer sentiment toward sustainability is 78%.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global recycled carbon market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing need in Electronic Devices 
- Growing Utilization in Aerospace Sector

***Challenges:***

The growing demand for virgin carbon fibers is one of the main factors predicted to impede market expansion. For instance, manufacturers favor virgin carbon fiber because recycled carbon fibers are less strong than virgin carbon fiber in the automotive and aerospace industries. 

By type, the global recycled carbon market is segmented into milled and chopped. The market is growing as car manufacturing increases. In the automotive sector, chopped recycled carbon has a wide range of potential applications. For instance, the mechanical qualities of composite materials, such as strength, stiffness, and fatigue resistance, can be increased by combining chopped recycled carbon fiber with polymer matrices; these composites are used in automotive parts. China topped the list of nations producing the most passenger automobiles, with an estimated 21 million vehicles produced in 2021. 

By region, Asia Pacific recycled carbon market is expected to hold a share of 38% by the end of 2036. The market growth will grow due to the region's expanding aerospace sector. The demand for recovered carbon fiber is anticipated to rise as the region's aerospace industry expands. For instance, since recycled carbon fiber may be used to create lightweight spacecraft and aircraft components, it can create chances for the development of new goods and technology in the aerospace industry. For instance, it is anticipated that by 2024, India's domestic aviation market will exceed USD 25 billion. Therefore, it is projected that these factors will accelerate market expansion throughout the anticipated time.
