**Peptide Synthesis Market trends growth & Analysis**

*Research Nester assesses the growth and market size of the global* peptide synthesis *market which is anticipated to be on account of the growing investment in the development of peptide-based drugs.* 

New York – May 15, 2023- Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Peptide Synthesis Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/peptide-synthesis-market/4800): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global peptide synthesis market in terms of market segmentation by product, technology, end-user, and by region. 

***Growing Demand for Personalized Medicine and Adoption of Precision Medicine to Promote Global Market Share of* Peptide Synthesis** 

The global peptide synthesis market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing demand for personalized medicine and the adoption of precision medicine. The development of personalized medicine is projected to enable physicians to tailor treatment to the specific needs and characteristics of individual patients. This allows for more accurate diagnosis and more effective treatment, with fewer side effects and better outcomes. There are currently over 300-310 personalized medicines available for people suffering from cancer, genetic diseases, chronic diseases, and infectious diseases. Peptides are increasingly used as therapeutic agents in precision medicine owing to their ability to precisely target disease-causing molecules. Demand for peptide synthesis is expected to increase significantly with increased investment in precision medicine R&D. 

Other factors that are expected to drive the growth of the peptide synthesis market include increasing focus on protein-based therapeutics, increasing investment in peptide-based drug development, an increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the growing recognition of the usefulness of peptides in research and clinical applications. *Every 34 seconds in the United States an individual dies out of cardiovascular disease.* Peptides have been used to treat these conditions and, owing to their high potency and improved safety, may also be used as an alternative to conventional medicines. This is expected to indicate the potential for market expansion within the forecast period. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global peptide synthesis market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Increased Use of Peptides in Covid-19 Treatment
- Rising Use of Peptides in Pharmaceutical Drugs Along with Rise in FDA Approvals 

***Challenges:***

The complexity of the peptides regulatory framework and approval processes makes it tough for companies to incorporate new peptide-based products into the market, as the process is both time-consuming and expensive. This creates a barrier to entry for new companies and limits the potential for market expansion. Also, the high cost of raw materials is anticipated to pose a challenge to the market growth in the forecast period These are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of peptide synthesis.

By region, the North American peptide synthesis market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. The market growth is mainly due to increasing government and research institute efforts to develop new peptide-based therapeutics. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease is increasing the demand for peptide-based pharmaceuticals, which drives the growth of the North American peptide synthesis market. As the prevalence of diabetes increases, so does the need for insulin and other drugs manufactured using peptide synthesis. Many drugs used to treat diabetes and its related conditions are made from peptides that can only be produced by peptide synthesis, which is expected to contribute to market growth in the region. *Diabetes affects 37.3 million people, or 11.3% of the US population. An estimated 28.7 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes. About 8.5 million people have diabetes but have not yet been diagnosed as of 2022.*
